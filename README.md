# pomodoro-timer

When learning programming, we often fall into the trap of tutorials. The best way to get out of it is to create something of your own. My intention was to create something that will be useful to me, so I created my own pomodoro-timer. Just before the creation of this project I was learning about css-grid so I gladly used it. A certain challenge was also displaying the current counter status in the tab of the page / browser bar. I'm happy that I created something that I can often use at work.
